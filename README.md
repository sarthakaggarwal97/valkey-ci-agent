# valkey-ci-agent

An AI agent for Valkey CI failure remediation, PR review, and automated backports.

## Features

- **CI Failure Agent** — analyzes workflow failures, generates and validates fixes, opens PRs with approval gating
- **PR Review Agent** — reviews pull requests via the GitHub API, posts summaries, publishes review comments, answers follow-up questions
- **Backport Agent** — cherry-picks merged PRs onto release branches with LLM-based conflict resolution
- **Fuzzer Monitor** — watches fuzzer runs, detects anomalies, creates GitHub issues
- **Central Valkey Monitor** — watches scheduled CI runs, tracks failure history, queues validated fixes

## Setup

Model selection is configured in YAML, not in secrets:

- `examples/config.yml` controls the CI failure agent model through `bedrock.model_id`
- `examples/pr-review-config.yml` controls the PR reviewer model through `reviewer.models.*`
- both configs also support optional `retrieval` settings for explicit Bedrock Knowledge Base lookup

AWS authentication is wired for GitHub Actions OIDC by default:

- GitHub Actions secret: `CI_BOT_AWS_ROLE_ARN`
- GitHub Actions variable: `CI_BOT_AWS_REGION`

Local development:

- copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
- fill in your own `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `AWS_REGION`, and `AWS_PROFILE`
- source `.env.local` manually before running scripts

## CI Failure Agent

The core feature. Reusable workflow at `.github/workflows/analyze-failure.yml`.

When a CI workflow fails in `valkey-io/valkey`, the agent:

1. detects and classifies the failure (build error, test failure, flaky test)
2. retrieves and parses logs using format-specific parsers (gtest, tcl, build errors, sentinel/cluster)
3. analyzes root cause using Amazon Bedrock
4. generates a candidate fix
5. validates the fix by re-running the failing workflow
6. queues the validated fix for human approval before opening a PR

Required GitHub configuration:

- secret: `AWS_ROLE_ARN`
- either secret: `VALKEY_GITHUB_TOKEN`
- or variable: `VALKEY_GITHUB_APP_ID` plus secret: `VALKEY_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`

## PR Review Agent

Reusable workflow at `.github/workflows/review-pr.yml`.

Reviews pull requests through the GitHub API without checking out PR head code in the privileged workflow. The reviewer uses direct Bedrock runtime calls, and can optionally inject explicit Bedrock KB retrieval into prompts. It can:

- post or update a PR summary comment
- generate optional release notes
- publish focused review comments
- answer follow-up `/reviewbot` questions in PR comments and review threads

The reviewer is intentionally defect-oriented and conservative. It prefers a
small number of high-confidence findings, generates structured candidate
findings, runs a skeptic verification pass before publishing, ranks surviving
findings by severity and confidence, and submits them as a single batched
review with a short top-level summary.

When deeper context is needed, the reviewer can fetch changed files at the PR
head SHA, inspect the full pre-change file at the base SHA, search code at the
pinned revision, and locate likely related tests. Test discovery uses the
project metadata in the reviewer config, including optional
`project.test_to_source_patterns` mappings.

Example consumer-repo files:

- `examples/pr-review-caller-workflow.yml`
- `examples/pr-review-config.yml`

For fork or cross-repo testing, `.github/workflows/review-external-pr.yml` lets you dispatch a one-off review against any `owner/repo#PR` reachable by your GitHub token or GitHub App installation. It does not require adding workflow files or config files to the target repository. The reviewer posts comments on the target PR, but its incremental state is stored on this agent repo's `bot-data` branch.

Config loading checks the target repo first (`.github/pr-review-bot.yml`), then falls back to this agent repo's checked-in config.

Useful reviewer config fields:

- `reviewer.custom_instructions` for project-specific invariants and review guidance
- `reviewer.project.source_dirs` and `reviewer.project.test_dirs` for source/test discovery
- `reviewer.project.test_to_source_patterns` to map changed source files to likely regression tests
- `reviewer.retrieval.*` to enable optional Bedrock Knowledge Base context

Required GitHub configuration:

- secret: `AWS_ROLE_ARN`
- either secret: `VALKEY_GITHUB_TOKEN`
- or variable: `VALKEY_GITHUB_APP_ID` plus secret: `VALKEY_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`

## Backport Agent

Reusable workflow at `.github/workflows/backport.yml`.

When a maintainer adds a `backport <branch>` label to a merged PR in `valkey-io/valkey`, a caller workflow in that repo triggers this agent. The agent cherry-picks the merged PR's commits onto the target release branch and opens a backport PR. If the cherry-pick produces merge conflicts, the agent uses Amazon Bedrock to resolve them, applying the original PR's intent to the diverged codebase.

The pipeline:

1. validates the target branch exists and no duplicate backport PR is open
2. checks the daily rate limit (default 10 PRs per 24 hours)
3. clones the repo, cherry-picks onto a `backport/<pr>-to-<branch>` branch
4. if conflicts arise, resolves them file-by-file using Bedrock (whitespace-only conflicts are resolved without LLM calls)
5. pushes the branch and opens a backport PR with labels, conflict details, and per-file resolution summaries
6. posts a summary comment on the source PR

The agent applies a `backport` label to every backport PR, and an `llm-resolved-conflicts` label when any file was resolved by the LLM, signaling that extra review attention is needed.

Generated backport PR bodies are verdict-first. They include a short backport
summary, a compact facts table, a reviewer checklist, the cherry-picked commit
list, conflict details, and a human-review warning when any file was
LLM-resolved.

Configuration is loaded from `.github/backport-agent.yml` in the consumer repo. When the file is missing, sensible defaults are used. Configurable settings include the Bedrock model ID, max conflict retries, max conflicting files, daily PR limit, per-backport token budget, and label names.

Example consumer-repo files:

- `examples/backport-caller-workflow.yml` — caller workflow triggered on `pull_request_target` `labeled` events
- `examples/backport-config.yml` — configuration with all available settings and defaults

Required GitHub configuration in the consumer repo:

- secret: `CI_BOT_AWS_ROLE_ARN` — IAM role assumable via GitHub OIDC for Bedrock access
- variable: `CI_BOT_AWS_REGION` (optional, defaults to `us-east-1`)

## Central Valkey Monitor

Workflow at `.github/workflows/monitor-valkey-daily.yml`.

Runs from this repo, watches new scheduled `Daily` runs in `valkey-io/valkey`, analyzes new failures, records per-job pass/fail history, validates candidate fixes, and queues approved-ready patches using the local config at `.github/valkey-daily-bot.yml`.

The workflow has two stages:

- `monitor`: runs automatically on schedule, analyzes failures, applies history-based queue gating, and queues validated fixes in this agent repo
- `create-approved-prs`: runs only after approval on the protected environment `valkey-pr-approval`

No PR is opened against `valkey-io/valkey` until that environment approval is granted.

Approval context is written into the workflow summary so you can review the root-cause rationale, files the agent wants to change, observed failure streak, and last known good / first bad commits when history exists.

Manual dispatch defaults to `dry_run=true` so you can inspect candidate runs without advancing state or queueing fixes. Dispatch with `dry_run=false` for a real automated pass; the workflow still stops at the approval gate before opening any PRs.

Required GitHub configuration:

- secret: `AWS_ROLE_ARN`
- either secret: `VALKEY_GITHUB_TOKEN`
- or variable: `VALKEY_GITHUB_APP_ID` plus secret: `VALKEY_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`

## Central Valkey Fuzzer Monitor

Workflow at `.github/workflows/monitor-valkey-fuzzer.yml`.

Runs from this repo, watches new scheduled `fuzzer-run.yml` executions in `valkey-io/valkey-fuzzer`, downloads the structured artifact bundle from each run when available, falls back to job logs when it is not, and writes a per-run anomaly summary using the local config at `.github/valkey-fuzzer-bot.yml`.

The fuzzer monitor is analysis-only:

- it does not open pull requests
- it distinguishes expected chaos behavior from anomalous behavior
- it automatically creates or updates a GitHub issue in `valkey-io/valkey-fuzzer` when a run is classified as `anomalous`
- it writes the analysis to the workflow summary
- it uploads the raw `fuzzer-monitor-result.json` payload as a workflow artifact

Generated anomaly issues are also verdict-first. Each issue includes a concise
status line, metadata table, action-needed section, reproduction command when
available, concrete findings grouped by severity, and collapsible normal
signals for lower-noise triage.

Required GitHub configuration:

- secret: `AWS_ROLE_ARN`
- either secret: `VALKEY_GITHUB_TOKEN`
- or variable: `VALKEY_GITHUB_APP_ID` plus secret: `VALKEY_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`

## Retrieval KB Refresh

Workflow at `.github/workflows/refresh-bedrock-kb.yml`.

Refreshes the existing Valkey code and docs knowledge bases used by retrieval:

- code KB: `OHQMPN9RCG`
- docs KB: `NAKLE24DH9`

The workflow is OIDC-only and uses:

- GitHub secret: `AWS_ROLE_ARN`
- GitHub variable: `AWS_REGION`

Manual runs default to `dry_run=true` so you can verify corpus prep and data-source discovery before mutating Bedrock.

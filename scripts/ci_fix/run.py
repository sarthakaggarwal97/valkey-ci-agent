"""Run one CI fix as three jobs: plan, fix, publish; a sweep's, as five.

Every front door runs its fix the same way, through ``ci-fix-run.yml``:
a Test Failure Detector issue (:mod:`scripts.ci_fix.issues`), a maintainer's
command on a pull request (:mod:`scripts.ci_fix.main`), a bot-owned pull
request's red head (:mod:`scripts.backport.ci_followup`), and a review of the
bot's pull request into the default branch (:mod:`scripts.ci_fix.upstream`).

1. ``plan``: the front door validates its request and binds one exact failed
   job (a :class:`FixPlan`); this module resolves that job from the workflow
   that ran it, if it can host the fix (:mod:`scripts.ci_fix.ci_job`).
2. ``fix``: :func:`scripts.ci_fix.engine.prepare_fix`, inside that job after
   its own setup and build (``scripts/ci_fix/job.sh``), or on the bot's own
   runner. It holds no GitHub token.
3. ``publish``: the candidate is published as its target says. A published
   fix or a refusal is reported on the target PR or issue; a failure stays in
   this repository's workflow logs and retry state.

A backport sweep's fix of the bot's own, for a test the default branch has
too, is made for the default branch before it is published:
``plan-upstream`` (:func:`plan_upstream`) resolves the default branch's own
job of the same name, and a second ``fix`` job, that one, makes the same fix
there (:func:`scripts.ci_fix.engine.prepare_upstream`). Its outcome is the one
published.

The plan, the resolved job and the fix's outcome pass between the jobs as
JSON (:mod:`scripts.ci_fix.state`).
